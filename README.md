# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project

## Easy Flat - Feel at home wherever you are.

This website has been developed for Code Institute´s User Centric Front End Development Project 1.
I wanted to create a website for a start up which works as Real Estate Agency. As described, Easy Flat offers different services: you can rent easily your own flat/rooms or find the best apartaments for your holidays at affordable prices.
Each area has been developed to make users navigation easy and give them all the info needed. 

### UX

This Project has been made according to the knowledge acquired during the HTML and CSS User-Centric Front End Development lessons.
The website was build following the principle Mobile First and the UX is designed using mostly the guidelines of Materialize CSS.

The main idea as described above was to develop a webiste for a start up that works as Real Estate Agency.

I decided to divide the website into 3 different html pages that contain:

Index1: This file is the main principle one, it contains the Home Page divided into three different sections: "Services, Registration, Host".
Quotesandmore: This file contains the quotes and other actions that the users may do after used one of our services. Also here i have divided the page into three sections: "Quotes, Share on Site, Refer a friend".
Meetourteam: Since is a start up and we are new to the market, I wanted to take the chance to present the team to our users. This page has only one section called "Meet our Team".

Scenarios and Features

The basic structure of each page is the same; this in order to allow the users a simple navigation.

The structure adopted is as follow:

Navbar: a simple responsive navigation bar with a dropdwn menu ("hamburger menu") on mobile devices. Furthermore, i have integrated the code using a Fixed Navbar in order to let the user´s navigation more simple and boost
the quality of the entire navigation.
Background images
Footer: A responsive footer in which is implemented the use of Font Awesome and Hover.css. In this seciont main content is how to "Contact US". I have listed all the Social links where we are present with our contents.

Please note, in order to do the structure of my project i got the inspiration from one of the open source template "Parallax Template" advertised on Materialize CSS.


User´s journey:

Users landed to our website:
As described below our target are people who are looking for a perfect apartament for holidays at affordable prices or just want to rent their own flat/rooms benefiting from our services.

Home Page (Index1.html)

This page, as described above, is the starting page of my Project.
It has been divided into three section. 
Services: Users can have a quick description of what we are exactly offering. The services list was beautified adding images using the class "circle responsive-img" from the Materilaize CSS documentation

Registration: Once we captured the interest of the users, we catch them with a CTA, inviting them to subscribe with their details to our newsletter in order to be contacted back and figures out how match our offers with their wishes. 
Clicking on the CTA "Sign up" will be displayed a form made using MailChimp; in this case, after creating the form, i have embedded the code and the script into my page.
Subscribing to the newsletter, the users will be informed in the future of all our new offers for all the destinations available and at the same time we will use their contact details to contact them back and match their wishes.
Furthermore, I was using also MailChimp for a CRM point of view. It will help us for future digital advertising activities.

Host: In this section, as Easy Flat works also as Real Estate Agency, i added the possibility to fill out a questionnaire, made using Typeform. The main scope of this form is to give us all the details of the user´s flat/rooms.
As described before, I have used Typeform and embedded the code into my page. The reason why i have used this tool is mostly because of the huge choices of styles and fonts in order to beautify my page.
Please note: if the questionnaires will be displayed in private mode feel free to use my log in details and get to my workspace: alessandrodfb@gmail.com pass:Ale1218029 LP: https://www.typeform.com/ 


Quotes and more (quotesandmore.html)

The user will get the access to this section through the CTA "Discover More" located in the Home Page.
Also for this section i have used the same criteria for the Navbar and the Footer. The only changes are the contents displayed. I have divided the page into three sections.

At the top of the Page we have always our payoff and a CTA "Click Here" where we invite our users to live us a review and a customer survey based on their experience with us. Also here the form has been created using Typeform 
and the code+script embedded properly into my page.
Scrolling imemdiately down we have the Quotes section.

Quotes:
In this part, there are some review of the users who had already tried our services.
This content has been developed using "Card Reveals" from the open source library of Materilaize CSS. Clicking on the card wil be displayed a text area where it´s visible our review. This type of card helps to give more interaction
with the website content. At the top, there is a link that should 
Each card shows a review based on the services offered from our website.

Share on Site:
This section is new on our page as displayed by the "new badge" coded alsways using the open source documentation on Materialize CSS.
In this section we ask to the users to share the best moment of their trips. There is a CTA "Share" where clicking on that will be displayed a form where the users can upload their pics and drop more details (e.g city where they were). 
The most beautiful, as said, will be shared on our blog

Refer a friend:
Since we are a start up, this section is used simply to grow our community and makes our services known. It´s a simple form made by using the open source library on Materialize CSS.

Meet our Team (meetourteam.html)

This section is dedicated to introduce our team to the users.
The deployment of the Cards has been made, like before, using the "Card Reveal" from Materialize CSS.


Social Share:

As displayed to the left of the Desktop, I have integrated each page with the link for Social Pages.
In order to do this I have used SUMOME and for Facebook, i have integrated my html using the "Open Graph". Social tools listed are: Facebook, Pinterest, Google+ and Email.
Furthermore, my project has been optimized in terms of SEO for further advertising activities.

Features Left to Implement:

Implement Social Networks creating our own pages; at the moment the share of the page on Facebook is going through my account;
Implement our Blog on Site, this helps us to boost the engagement of our Webiste among the users and fullfill the aim of the share of the "best moments of the trip";
Implement a proper section on the Website where users can select a date range, a city, and search their apartament like in others "Booking Websites";
Implement a section where users can make their payments online; at the moment is only available via bank transfer.
